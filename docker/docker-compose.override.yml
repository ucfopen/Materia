# loaded by default unless you use docker-compose -f flag
# this is needed because we want test to mount throw-away file storage that doesn't affect your dev environment
# docker-compose won't let an override file define the same mount point.
# since this file is loaded by default except when using -f to load a different override, that avoids
# the problem of multiple mounts at the same point
