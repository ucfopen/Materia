# Materia

Materia is a platform and ecosystem for small, self-contained, customizable e-learning applications called _widgets_, designed to enhance digital course content. Widgets in the catalog can be customized by instructors to suit their instructional goals and objectives, then shared with students directly or embedded in an LMS through LTI.

Materia and its associated library of widgets is an open-source project of the University of Central Florida's Center for Distributed Learning.

# This repo is for the Materia Django Rewrite. You might be looking for [ucfopen/Materia](https://github.com/ucfopen/Materia) instead.

This version of Materia is **heavily work-in-progress**. You have been warned.

## Setup and installation

We recommend cloning this repository alongside the PHP version of Materia. The two can coexist, and you will probably need PHP Materia to reference the original codebase:

```
$ mkdir materia-django
$ git clone git@github.com:ucfopen/Materia.git materia-django
```

Additional instructions forthcoming.
