# The Big Picture #

Materia is a platform used to deliver high quality interactive widgets for your online course. The student's role couldn't be more simple, but here are a few concepts to familiarize yourself with.

## What is a Widget? ##

It can be a game, a study tool, a simulation, almost anything really. A widget can be as simple as a study tool like flash cards or something more advanced such as a 3D simulation with complex story lines.  As a student you will be assigned widgets which you will have to complete.

## Who Creates Widgets? ##

Instructors from your institution can create widgets.  Your institution may allow students to build widgets as well. An easy way to test if you can create your own content is to visit the *My Widgets* page.

# Playing Widgets #

## Play Link ##

All widgets have a unique Play Link or URL. Visiting the link in your browser will take you directly to the widget. You may be asked to log into Materia before using the widget if you are not logged in already.

## Embedded Player ##

All published widgets also have the option of being embedded in a page or in an online course. In these cases, you may not even realize you're using Materia as it seamlessly integrates into its surroundings.
