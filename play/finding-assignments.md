# Where Do I Find My Assignments? #

## Direct Play Link ##

Students cannot find widgets assigned to them from the Materia site. Instead, widgets are shared with students by sending a play link. It is the responsibility of the instructor to share the play link url to his or her students. In many cases, widget play link urls are distributed through course materials or email.

## Play History ##

Your entire play history is available in on your profile page. It lists all widgets for which you have earned a score. Read more in the
[Viewing Scores]({{BASE_PATH}}/play/viewing-scores.html) section.
