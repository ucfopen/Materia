## Details ##

### Sorting ###

Drag tiles from the game board to the **Sequence list area** in the correct order. Tiles with a speech bubble icon have a **description** which appears when you mouse over the tile.

### Submitting ###

When you've ordered the tiles to your liking click on the **Submit** button. This will show you how many items you have in the right sequence. If you don't have the correct sequence you may be deducted points based on the **Penalty information** (in this example every incorrect submission deducts 10 points). Once you've submitted the correct sequence or are deducted 100 points you'll be taken to the score screen.
