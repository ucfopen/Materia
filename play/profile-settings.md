## Notifications ##

By default, notifications are sent when a widget is shared with you. To disable this feature, uncheck the *Send me an email when a widget has been shared with me* option.

## User Icon ##

By default, [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/) is used as the provider of user icons for Materia. Gravtar associates an email address to an image (or, a gravatar). To set up or change your Gravatar settings, visit their service at [Gravatar.com](http://en.gravatar.com/).
