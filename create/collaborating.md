# Sharing Widgets with Others #

Sharing widgets will allow you to collaborate with others to build your widget, distribute to students, and collect score results.

## The Collaboration Dialog ##

To share a widget, select it on the *My Widgets* page and click *Collaborate*.

## Searching for Users ##

To find users type their name or email address into the *Add People* input box at the top of the Collaboration dialog. Materia will search for that user as you type, providing matched results from which you can select.

<aside>Note that you can only share with users that are current instructors in Materia.</aside>

## Collaboration Options ##

### Full ###

Grants the user a complete control. In addition to distributing the widget to students and receiving scores, the user may edit, copy, or delete the widget, as well as add or remove others from the list of collaborators.

### View Scores ###

Allows the user to distribute the widget among students and receive scores. The user cannot, however, edit, delete, or copy the widget.

### Expiration ###

You may set an expiration for each person's permissions. After this date, the collaboration will be revoked and the user will no longer have access to the widget.

<aside>
	Keep in mind that users with the *Full* permission level may edit their own expiration date.
