## Common Questions & Issues

### General

#### Is Materia part of the LMS?

No. Materia is a platform that operates independently to the LMS, but integrates with it through a protocol called LTI.
You can authenticate to Materia through LTI, or directly by visiting the Login button.

#### Are there login credentials specific to Materia?

That depends on how your institution has configured Materia. If you visit Materia through your LMS, authentication is
handled for you. If you log in directly to Materia, you may need credentials specifically set up for Materia. If logging
in transitions you to an external login, use the credentials associated with that external login instead.

#### I'm an instructor, why does Materia think I'm suddenly a student?

Materia defers to your LMS when receiving login information that may include your role in the course you last accessed
Materia from. Depending on your course role, your role in Materia may update to match. For example, if you are
instructor in Course A but a student in Course B, Materia will flag you as a student if you visit Materia content
embedded in Course B. Visiting Materia content in Course A will once again grant you the author role.

#### Can my students author widgets?

Yes they can, but student-authored widgets have several limitations. Primarily, the widget is forced into Guest Mode,
which removes the login requirement, but all scores recorded by Guest Mode widgets are anonymous. Student-authored
widgets cannot be embedded in your LMS, and if a student grants you access, you cannot disable Guest Mode. Students can
freely share their widgets with other users using the Play URL or Embed Code.

### Scores & Grades

#### Does Materia save student grades?

Materia does not save grade information, but it does save student performance data. Student scores are stored and can be
reviewed any time by visiting the Student Activity section of a widget in My Widgets. When embedded in your LMS, Materia
sends a score percentage to the LMS that's then applied as a point value or grade by the LMS itself for an assignment.

#### How does scoring work?

By default, a student must authenticate to Materia - either automatically, when accessed through the LMS, or directly,
by clicking the Login button - so the system knows who they are and who to associate a score with. All score data for a
widget is accessible under the Student Activity section in My Widgets. Additionally, student performance data can be
exported at any time by clicking the Export Options button in My Widgets.

#### My widget is embedded in the LMS but the gradebook did not update! What happened?

This can happen for multiple reasons. First, ensure the widget is properly embedded in your LMS by reviewing
[our documentation for embedding widgets in Canvas](https://ucfopen.github.io/Materia-Docs/create/embedding-in-canvas.html).
Next, verify the score the student received by reviewing the widget's Student Activity section in Materia under My Widgets.
If a score is present in Materia but not synced with the gradebook, contact Support. Often the "handshake" between
Materia and the LMS can fail or be invalidated for several reasons that are not nefarious.

### Widget Ownership

#### Can I give other instructors access to a widget?

Yes. Select **Collaborate** in My Widgets to share widgets with other users. You can search for any other Materia user
in the search field, provided they've interacted with Materia at least once in the past. You can grant other users one
of two access levels: **Full**, which effectively makes a user a co-owner, or **View Scores**, which allows a user to
share and read score information related to a widget but they cannot edit it.

#### Can I make students co-owners of a widget?

You cannot share widgets with students unless they have been set to **Guest Mode**, under a widget's access settings.
As a general rule, Materia will not allow students ownership access to widgets unless the scores associated with the
widgets are anonymized. Conversely, widgets authored by students are forced into Guest Mode, and changing a student
widget you co-own to Normal Access will remove the student as an owner.

#### I see a widget embedded in my course in the LMS, but I don't own it. What do I do?

Don't panic! Even if you don't own the widget, it will continue to function normally, and sync scores with the gradebook
if configured to do so. If you're an author of the course, you will be provided with a list of owners of the widget, and
can select **Request Access** from any owner. The owner will receive a notification in Materia and be provided with an
option to add you as a collaborator. Note that this does not guarantee you will receive access! In cases where the
original owner is no longer associated with your institution, feel free to contact Support.

### Miscellaneous

#### How do I activate Beard Mode?

What? We don't know what you're talking about.
