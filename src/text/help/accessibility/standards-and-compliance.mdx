### Accessibility Standards and Compliance

Materia widgets are often highly interactive, gamified experiences that exceed the characteristics of traditional web
documents. While we strive to ensure adherence to WCAG 2.0 AA standards wherever possible, certain widgets may not be
fully capable of supporting those standards. Widgets are proactively labeled based on their level of support for two
major elements of WCAG 2.0 AA standards compliance: keyboard navigation and screen reader support. Materia and its
widgets strive to adhere to the following accessibility guidelines:

- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA
- Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act
- Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) digital accessibility requirements
